The use of Gen AI will enable the generation of innovative solutions, providing valuable insights from vast amounts of data, and the evaluation techniques will ensure that the generated outputs meet the required standards of accuracy, reliability, and safety.
Alex: Martin, can you explain how Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the field of system engineering?
Martin: Absolutely, Alex. Gen AI and LLMs have the potential to revolutionize system engineering by improving the efficiency and accuracy of system design. LLMs can analyze vast amounts of data, extract patterns, and generate complex outputs that aid decision-making and problem-solving in system design. This can enable engineers to streamline design tasks, enhance creativity, and optimize system performance.
Alex: That's fascinating. Can you elaborate on how LLMs can aid decision-making and problem-solving in system design?
Martin: Yes, certainly. LLMs can generate novel solutions, interpret complex data, and provide previously unattainable solutions with traditional computational approaches. For instance, LLMs can be used to generate design options, predict system behavior, and identify potential design flaws, allowing engineers to make more informed decisions.
Alex: I see. So, what's the current state of evaluating system design documents generated by LLMs like GPT-4?
Martin: Currently, evaluating LLM-generated content is a challenge. Existing methods, such as BLEU, ROUGE, BARTScore, BERTScore, and GPTScore, measure word usage precision, content overlap, semantic coherence, and factual correctness. However, these methods fall short in assessing system design-specific documents due to their specialized terminology and complex structures. They don't capture engineering principles, innovation, and practical applicability.
Alex: That's interesting. How do you think advanced LLMs can help address this limitation?

For example, fine-tuned LLMs can predict content quality based on human-rated datasets, effectively assessing subjective tasks. This can help overcome the limitations of human-led evaluation processes, which can be time-consuming and costly.
Alex: That makes sense. What are some potential applications of Gen AI and LLMs in system engineering, and what further research is needed?
Martin: Gen AI and LLMs have the potential to transform system engineering in areas like autonomous transportation, traffic networks, and cloud-based software systems. Further research is needed to develop tailored metrics for assessing the technical accuracy, reliability, and compliance of system design outputs, as well as exploring the potential of Gen AI and LLMs in other phases of system engineering, such as requirement analysis and testing.
Alex: Last question, Martin. What kind of frameworks or standards do you think are necessary to integrate Gen AI and LLMs in system engineering?
Martin: That's a great question, Alex. Developing frameworks, standards, and guidelines for the use of Gen AI and LLMs in system engineering is crucial. This would provide a structured approach to integrating these technologies, ensuring consistency, and promoting best practices across the industry.
Alex: Martin, can you start by explaining the system design generation and evaluation process? How does it work?
Martin: The system design generation and evaluation process is a complex task that involves the creation of detailed design documents, or DesDocs, based on system requirements and constraints. The process is facilitated by the SE Assistant, a tool that leverages Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (M-RAG) to enhance the capabilities of GPT-4 for system design-specific generation.
Alex: That sounds fascinating. Can you walk me through the steps involved in generating a DesDoc using the SE Assistant?
Martin: Sure. The process begins with the input of system requirements and constraints, which form the foundational data for generating the DesDoc. The SE Assistant then crafts queries based on the input data, capturing the essence of the requirements to search for relevant information within a vector database. These queries are processed through an embedding model, converting natural language into mathematical vectors to match pre-indexed data in the vector database.
Alex: I see. So, the SE Assistant is using the embedding model to retrieve relevant context from the vector database. How does GPT-4 come into play in this process?
Martin: Ah, that's the next step. The retrieved context is then fed into GPT-4, which uses it to understand the design requirements and generate informed content. GPT-4 synthesizes the generated content to produce a comprehensive DesDoc, including descriptions, design solutions, diagrams, and essential components.
Alex: That's impressive. How does the evaluation process work? What criteria are used to assess the generated DesDoc?
Martin: The evaluation process is also facilitated by the SE Assistant, which dynamically generates evaluation criteria crucial for system design, including technical accuracy, compliance with standards, feasibility, innovation, and alignment with system requirements. These criteria are then used to evaluate the generated DesDoc using a chain of robust LLMs, each offering unique strengths for a comprehensive and unbiased appraisal.
Alex: I understand. And how are the outputs of the LLMs combined to form the Evaluation Score?
Martin: The outputs of the LLMs are combined into a weighted average score, which forms the Evaluation Score. The Evaluation Score is calculated using the following equation: Evaluation Score = ∑[Wi] * ∑[cj], where Wi are the weights assigned to each LLM and cj are the criteria scores for each evaluation metric.
Alex: That makes sense. But what role do human engineers play in the evaluation process? Don't they have a say in the final Evaluation Score?
Martin: Absolutely. Human engineers play a critical role in the evaluation process, providing insights into practical aspects such as manufacturability, integration, and user experience. Their input ensures that the results align with human standards and expectations, checking the LLM evaluations. The combined evaluation approach ensures a comprehensive review, with the Evaluation Score providing a data-driven baseline and the engineer's input adding critical human insight.
Alex: I see. So, the system design generation and evaluation process is a complex task that requires the integration of multiple components, including the SE Assistant, LLMs, and human engineers. Can you summarize the key benefits of this approach?
Martin: Yes, the key benefits of this approach include the creation of detailed design documents, evaluation against predefined criteria, and the use of multiple LLMs to provide a comprehensive and unbiased appraisal. The Evaluation Score provides a data-driven baseline for the evaluation of the DesDoc, while the engineer's input adds critical human insight, ensuring that the results align with human standards and expectations.
Alex: Martin, let's dive into the implementation flow. Can you explain the three primary stages involved in this process?
Martin: The three primary stages are defining evaluation criteria, generation flow, and evaluation flow. These stages work together to produce a comprehensive and reliable system design document, or DesDoc.
Alex: That's a great overview. Let's start with defining evaluation criteria. What factors are considered when establishing these criteria, and how do they ensure the quality of the DesDoc?
Martin: The evaluation criteria encompass technical accuracy, innovation, compliance, and practical implementation. We integrate industry standards, best practices, and insights from similar projects to ensure the criteria are comprehensive and reflect current industry trends. This set of criteria provides a clear benchmark for assessing the DesDoc and is transparent, consistent, and flexible enough to be updated as the project evolves.
Alex: I see. So, these criteria serve as a benchmark for the entire system design process. Moving on to the generation flow, can you walk me through the steps involved in generating the preliminary DesDoc?
Martin: The generation flow involves several steps. First, the system requirements and constraints are ingested by the SE Assistant. Then, the SE Assistant formulates prompts that encapsulate the requirements, guiding the generation process. The prompts are processed through the M-RAG pipeline, consisting of an embedding model and a vector database, which translates the prompts into vector representations. The vectors retrieve relevant context from the database, informing the generated DesDoc. Finally, GPT-4 generates a preliminary DesDoc addressing the requirements and constraints.
Alex: That's a complex process. Can you explain the role of the M-RAG pipeline in more detail? How does it contribute to the generation of the DesDoc?
Martin: The M-RAG pipeline is a crucial component of the generation flow. The embedding model takes the prompts and translates them into vector representations, which are then used to retrieve relevant context from the vector database. This context informs the generated DesDoc, ensuring that it meets the system's requirements and constraints. The M-RAG pipeline enables the SE Assistant to generate high-quality DesDocs by leveraging the power of vector representations and context retrieval.
Alex: I understand. Now, let's move on to the evaluation flow. How do the Large Language Models (LLMs) and the human engineer contribute to the evaluation of the DesDoc?
Martin: In the evaluation flow, the LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-2, and Gemini) evaluate the DesDoc against the established evaluation criteria, each assigning a score from 1 to 10. The scores are then aggregated into a preliminary Evaluation Score by taking the weighted average based on their reliability and domain expertise. A human engineer reviews the document, providing a score and detailed comments, adding domain-specific expertise and practical judgment. The LLMs' Evaluation Score and the engineer's score are combined into a Combined Score, reflecting the engineer's expertise relative to the LLMs.
Alex: That's interesting. Can you explain why the weighted average is used to aggregate the LLMs' scores, and how the human engineer's input is incorporated into the Combined Score?
Martin: We use a weighted average to aggregate the LLMs' scores because it allows us to take into account the reliability and domain expertise of each model. This ensures that the preliminary Evaluation Score is a more accurate reflection of the DesDoc's quality. The human engineer's input is incorporated into the Combined Score by combining the LLMs' Evaluation Score with the engineer's score, giving more weight to the engineer's expertise relative to the LLMs. This approach leverages the strengths of both AI and human intelligence to provide a more robust and nuanced evaluation of the DesDoc.
Alex: I see. So, the implementation flow is designed to combine the strengths of AI and human intelligence to produce a comprehensive and reliable DesDoc. How does this flow contribute to the overall system design process?
Martin: The implementation flow is a critical component of the system design process. By integrating generative and evaluative processes, we can produce a high-quality DesDoc that meets the system's requirements and constraints. The evaluation flow provides a robust and nuanced evaluation of the DesDoc, and the combined score calculation ensures that the final evaluation is accurate and comprehensive. This approach enables us to leverage the strengths of both AI and human intelligence to produce a reliable and innovative system design.
Alex: Hi Martin, thanks for joining us today. Can you start by explaining what Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is and how it's being used in system design documentation?
Martin: Absolutely, Alex. Gen AI refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate new, original content, such as text or images. In the context of system design documentation, Gen AI is being used to generate design documentation (DesDocs) that accurately capture the requirements and specifications of complex systems. This involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text that's both accurate and readable.
Alex: That's fascinating. Can you walk us through the evaluation process you used to test the performance of the LLM-generated DesDocs?
Martin: Yes, of course. We developed a rigorous evaluation process that assessed the performance of the LLM-generated DesDocs across five criteria: Performance, Scalability, Reliability, Usability, and Security. We assigned weights to each criterion and calculated an evaluation score using a formula that took into account the scores for each criterion. We then compared the performance of three different LLMs: GPT-4, Claude-2, and Gemini.
Alex: I see. And what were the results of the evaluation process?
Martin: Our results showed that the M-RAG (SE Assistant) tool, which combines GPT-4 with a M-RAG pipeline, outperformed the other two LLMs in terms of requirements met, evaluation score, and combined score. Specifically, M-RAG met 64% of requirements in the Single-vendor setup and 51% in the Multi-vendor setup, with evaluation scores of 8.6 and 8.5, respectively.
Alex: Those are impressive results. Can you explain why you think M-RAG performed so well compared to the other two LLMs?
Martin: We believe that M-RAG's superior performance is due to its ability to integrate textual, visual, and tabular data to produce accurate DesDocs. Additionally, the M-RAG pipeline ensures high standards of technical accuracy and compliance, which is critical in system design documentation.
Alex: That makes sense. What are the implications of your study for the field of software engineering?
Martin: Our study demonstrates the potential of Gen AI to improve the efficiency and accuracy of system design documentation, which is a critical component of software engineering. The use of LLM-generated DesDocs could revolutionize the way system design documentation is created and maintained, freeing up system engineers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.
Alex: That's exciting. What's next for this research? Are there any plans to build on these findings?
Martin: Yes, we're already planning to enhance the SE Assistant tool by incorporating dynamic, context-aware multi-agent mechanisms that integrate human feedback into the AI's learning process. This will further enhance the tool's capabilities and improve the accuracy and reliability of the DesDocs generated.
Alex: Well, thank you, Martin, for sharing your insights with us today. It's clear that the application of Gen AI in system design documentation has significant potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of this critical process.
Martin: Thank you, Alex. It was a pleasure to share our research with your audience.
