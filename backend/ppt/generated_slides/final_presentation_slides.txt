#Content:
This research paper explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in reshaping healthcare, with a focus on the limitations of Generative AI and the emergence of a productivity paradox within the sector. The study investigates the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Generative AI chatbots to address these challenges. A Retrieval Augmented Generative AI Chatbot framework is presented, designed for consultation summaries, diagnostic insights, and emotional assessments of patients. The technical value of this framework is demonstrated in its ability to drive service innovation, patient engagement, and workflow efficiencies, thereby contributing to the resolution of the AI productivity paradox in healthcare.

#Content: 
Generative AI models have demonstrated advanced conversational abilities in healthcare, leading to the development of specialized models. Despite capabilities and performance gains, Generative AI has significant limitations, including "AI hallucinations" where models fabricate information. Key limitations and features include:
- "AI hallucinations" due to vague prompts, static parametric knowledge, and insufficient training data
- Productivity paradox, defined as the decrease in workplace productivity despite an increase in technology investment
- Premature adoption and resistance to change as typical reasons for productivity paradox
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generative) approach as an effective solution, merging retrieval-based and generative models to enhance accuracy and relevance of generated text
- Potential of RAG in bridging the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical medical service delivery
